            <p class="lb_desc">
                  At first, Flynn comes off as cocky, arrogant, and a little self-centered. As an experienced thief, he is skilled in escaping the authorities, hiding out, and stealing right from under people&#39;s noses. However, as he begins to fall in love with Rapunzel, he transforms into a more compassionate, chivalrous, and trustworthy person, and changes his priorities.

            <p class="lb_desc">
                  She locked Rapunzel into her tower when she was a baby. As Rapunzel grows up, she has then believed that Mother Gothel has always been her mother and her motherly figure. However, each year on Rapunzel&#39;s birthday, floating lights come from the castle which Rapunzel curiously sees at her tower window and she then wonders what they are and what they mean and why they only come on her birthday.

                  Maximus is a dedicated guard horse who will stop at nothing to take down the criminal he is after. Maximus is brave, daring, bold and not at all cowardly even being more feared than his captain. Although Maximus can be extremely tough, he has a large heart and even becomes best friends with his former arch enemy Flynn Ryder as they join together to reunite Rapunzel with her family.

            <p class="lb_desc">
                  Pascal is a true and loyal friend to Rapunzel. Even though he can&#39;t communicate verbally, he is one of the driving forces in pushing Rapunzel to leave the tower. Pascal is constantly cheering Rapunzel up, rooting her on, and refusing to allow her to take steps backwards.
